# Founder-Investor Matching Platform

## Overview

The Founder-Investor Matching Platform is a sophisticated system that leverages generative AI to create meaningful connections between founders and potential investors. By analyzing compatibility across multiple dimensions, the platform provides data-driven insights that help both parties make more informed decisions about potential partnerships.

The core technology employs advanced natural language processing and pattern recognition to evaluate the nuanced factors that contribute to successful founder-investor relationships, going beyond simple keyword matching to understand the deeper compatibility factors that lead to successful funding partnerships.

```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Matching

```python
from founder_investor_platform import FounderInvestorMatchingPlatform

# Initialize the platform
platform = FounderInvestorMatchingPlatform(api_key='your-api-key-here')

# Add a founder
founder = {
    'name': 'TechInnovate AI',
    'industry': 'Artificial Intelligence',
    'stage': 'Seed',
    'funding_needed': 1500000,
    'location': 'San Francisco',
    'team_size': 5,
    'product_description': 'AI-powered content optimization platform for digital marketers',
    'traction': '20% MoM growth, 50+ beta customers',
    'vision': 'Democratize advanced content optimization for businesses of all sizes'
}
platform.add_founders_to_database([founder])

# Add investors
investors = [
    {
        'name': 'Tech Future Fund',
        'industries': ['AI', 'SaaS', 'FinTech'],
        'stages': ['Seed', 'Series A'],
        'typical_check': '1M-3M',
        'locations': ['San Francisco', 'New York', 'Remote'],
        'portfolio': ['AI Analytics Inc', 'DataDrive Solutions'],
        'thesis': 'Investing in AI-first companies transforming traditional industries'
    },
    # More investors...
]
platform.add_investors_to_database(investors)

# Find matches
match_results = platform.find_match('TechInnovate AI', top_n=3)

# View match report
print(match_results['match_report'])
```

### Advanced Usage: Batch Processing

```python
# Process multiple founders
founders_data = load_founders_from_csv('founders.csv')
platform.add_founders_to_database(founders_data)

# Batch matching
batch_results = platform.batch_match(min_score=0.7)

# Export results
platform.export_match_data(format='csv', filename='match_results.csv')

# Generate insights
market_insights = platform.get_market_insights()
```

### Gradio Interface

The platform includes an intuitive web interface built with Gradio:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    launch_interface()
```

This will start a local web server accessible at http://localhost:7860, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the platform.
