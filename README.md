# PitchDeckAnalyzer

A powerful Python tool that leverages Google's Gemini AI to analyze startup pitch decks, providing detailed scoring, feedback, and visualizations to help founders improve their presentations before approaching investors.

## Overview

PitchDeckAnalyzer uses advanced AI to evaluate the key components of a startup pitch deck, providing expert-level feedback across critical sections including problem statement, solution, market analysis, business model, financials, and team composition. The tool extracts text from PDF pitch decks, analyzes each section independently, and provides an overall assessment of fundraising readiness.

## Features

- **PDF Text Extraction**: Automatically extracts text from uploaded pitch deck PDFs, with OCR capability for image-heavy decks
- **Section Identification**: Uses AI to identify and categorize key sections of the pitch deck
- **Section-by-Section Analysis**: Provides detailed evaluation of each core section with scores and specific feedback
- **Visual Reports**: Generates radar charts and bar graphs to visualize strengths and weaknesses
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Delivers concrete suggestions for improvement
- **Fundraising Readiness Assessment**: Evaluates overall readiness for investor presentations
- **Downloadable Reports**: Exports complete analysis as Markdown reports

## Demo Results

I tested the analyzer with Uber's original pitch deck and generated comprehensive results including visualizations and a detailed report. The analysis provides scores for each section, highlights strengths and weaknesses, and offers specific recommendations for improvement.

The radar chart shows relative strengths across different sections, while the bar chart provides absolute scores:

def upload_and_analyze():
    """Function to handle pitch deck upload and analysis"""
    print("Please upload your pitch deck PDF...")
    uploaded = files.upload()

    if uploaded:
        filename = list(uploaded.keys())[0]
        print(f"Analyzing uploaded pitch deck: {filename}")
        results = analyzer.analyze_pitch_deck(filename)
        analyzer.display_analysis_results(results)
        analyzer.save_analysis_report(results, f"{os.path.splitext(filename)[0]}_analysis.md")
        print("Analysis complete! Download the report using the link above.")

# Create an upload button
upload_button = widgets.Button(
    description='Upload & Analyze Your Pitch Deck',
    button_style='primary',
    icon='upload'
)
upload_button.on_click(lambda b: upload_and_analyze())
display(upload_button)
```

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The tool is built around the `PitchDeckAnalyzer` class which provides:

1. PDF processing with text extraction and OCR fallback
2. Section identification using Gemini AI
3. Section-by-section evaluation with scoring metrics
4. Overall pitch assessment
5. Visualization generation
6. Report creation and export

### Section Weights

Different sections are weighted according to their importance in investor evaluation:

- Problem: 15%
- Solution: 20%
- Market: 15%
- Business Model: 15%
- Financials: 15%
- Team: 10%
- Overall: 10%

## Sample Output
here is the document of the analysis 

For each section, the analyzer provides:
- Score (0-100)
- Key strengths
- Areas for improvement
- Specific recommendations

Example section output:
```
### Solution (Score: 65/100)

#### Strengths
- Clear value proposition addressing the identified pain points
- Innovative approach to connecting riders and drivers
- Simple and intuitive explanation of how the service works

#### Areas for Improvement
- Limited differentiation from existing taxi services
- Insufficient explanation of technological advantages
- No mention of barriers to entry or defensibility

#### Recommendations
- Include comparison with closest competitors to highlight unique advantages
- Elaborate on technological platform that enables the solution
- Emphasize proprietary elements or other competitive moats
```

## Future Development

Planned future enhancements include:
- Support for PowerPoint/Google Slides formats
- Comparative analysis against successful pitch decks in similar industries
